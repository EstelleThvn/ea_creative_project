# BlendedFaces
BlendedFaces is a facial recognition project created by Anastasiya Balan and Estelle Thouvenin, and based on ml5’s Facemesh.
You can see the final result here : https://estellethvn.github.io/ea_creative_project/.  

To use this feature you need to allow the use of your webcam, then wait for the video to be loaded. When the video will be loaded you must see yourself on the left side of the screen. Then you must click on the button “choisir un fichier”, where you have to upload a face image. It will work better if the face image uploaded is clear and is from the front. Then, you will be able to see facial recognition points on your face and your mouth and eyes on the face image you uploaded. Note that the first image loading might take a bit of time.

## What is BlendedFaces?
BlendedFaces is THE trendy filter. Select an image of one of your friends or a celebrity, one of your choice, and let the site put your mouth and eyes over the selected image. Make them do weird faces, sing the worst songs or make them say anything you want.
